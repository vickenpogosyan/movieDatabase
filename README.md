# Movie Database
This is my first project on GitHub.  
 - Collaborated in a team of four to design a relational PostgreSQL database modeling movies, actors, directors, genres, cinemas, showtimes, tickets, awards, and more by creating individual joinable tables and populating them with realistic synthetic data
 - Developed and optimized 10+ SQL queries using joins, aggregation, and filtering to analyze relationships between movies, actor/director demographics, genres, budgets, ratings, and awards
 - Independently developing a Spring Boot RESTful API connected to PostgreSQL to expose database data through structured endpoints
 - Implementing authentication and authorization to securely manage future user access and protect CRUD operations on API endpoints

We first designed an Entity-Relationship (ER) model to serve as a guideline for structuring the database schema before implementing tables and writing SQL queries.
