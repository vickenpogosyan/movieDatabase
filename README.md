# Movie Database
This is my first project on GitHub.  
 - Collaborated in a team of four using PostgreSQL to design a relational database modeling movies, actors, directors, genres, cinemas, showtimes, tickets, awards, and more by creating individual joinable tables and populating them with realistic synthetic data.  
 - Developed and optimized 10+ SQL queries using joins, aggregation, and filtering to analyze relationships between movies, actor/director demographics, genres, budgets, ratings, and awards.

We first designed an Entity-Relationship (ER) model to serve as a guideline for structuring the database schema before implementing tables and writing SQL queries.
